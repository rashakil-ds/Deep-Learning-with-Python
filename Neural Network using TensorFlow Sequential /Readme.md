# MNIST Neural Network with TensorFlow Sequential API

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a simple neural network using TensorFlow's Sequential API. The model is trained on the **MNIST dataset**, which consists of handwritten digits (0-9).

## Features
- Preprocessing and normalization of MNIST data
- Building a fully connected neural network using the Sequential API
- Training the model with a validation split
- Visualizing training and validation performance
- Evaluating the model on the test dataset
- Saving and loading the trained model

## Dataset
The [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. It contains:
- **60,000 training images**
- **10,000 test images**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed:
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

You can install the dependencies using:
